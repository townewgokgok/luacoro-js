 *     The iterator is not resumed while this, which means that
 *     this coroutine waits `n` frames including the current frame.
 *
 * - `i`: An `Iterator` of the same type as `start`
 *   - When `i` is `return`ed, the current iterator is terminated
 *     and `i` is immediately started to iterate as the replacement.
 *   - When `i` is `yield`ed, the current iterator is paused and pushed onto the stack,
 *     and `i` is immediately started to iterate.
 *     After `i` is terminated, the caller iterator is popped from the stack
 *     and continued to be iterated.
